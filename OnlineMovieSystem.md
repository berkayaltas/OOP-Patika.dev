# OnlineMovieSystem

Design the system of the application that sells or rents movies online.

- Movies can be listed and sorted in the app and users can subscribe to the app.
- Users purchase credits through the system for subscription.
- Only subscribed users can rent movies with their credits and the credit amount of the rented movie is deducted from their account.
- Regular users and subscribers can purchase movies.
- If the film is not available, it can be requested.
